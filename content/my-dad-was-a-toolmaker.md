Bit of a shorter post than usual, just to put üõ†Ô∏è [mydadwasatoolmaker.uk](https://mydadwasatoolmaker.uk) on here as it was just a quick project and not really deserving of a seperate section on this website.

Hopefully it can be kind of forgotten about as a quick joke until the domain comes up to renewal, otherwise it'll be an ¬£8 shitpost instead of a ¬£4 one.

# Why?

The current Labour leader, [Keir Starmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer), uses the phrase "my dad was a toolmaker" a lot, so as I had some time to kill I decided to try and find as many instances of it being said as possible.

The domain was free (and cheap), I had a free afternoon and as I write this the [general election campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election) is ongoing.

# Technical details

If you're really interested, there's not much but here they are:

Static website built with SvelteKit (overkill I know), hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Other stuff is Tailwind and Bootstrap icons.

Like I said there's not much.

# Conclusion

I might add more to it or just completely forget about it until the domain comes up for renewal. Who knows?
