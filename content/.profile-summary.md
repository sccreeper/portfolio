I'm a programmer currently completing my second year of a Computer Science BSc degree at the University of Portsmouth. The main languages I use are @mediumblue **Python** @, @gold **JavaScript** @ and @#00acd7 **Go** @. I also have some experience with @#2bb6f6 **Dart** @ as part of developing the mobile app for Chime and through university. 

Other than programming languages I typically like to use either @orange **SvelteKit** @ or **Flask** when developing new server based projects. As for database engines I am most familiar with @#336791 **PostgreSQL** @ and **SQLite**. This blog runs on a VPS in a @#1d63ed **Docker** @ container behind @#f4811f **Cloudflare** @.

Most of [the posts](/posts) on this blog are technical in nature however a few are about my other interests - mainly record collecting. I also read regularly and watch a fair number of films.
