I'm a programmer in my first year of a Computer Science BSc degree at the University of Portsmouth. The main languages I use are @mediumblue **Python** @, @gold **JavaScript** @ and @deepskyblue **Go** @. Most of the posts on this blog are technical in nature however a few are about my other interests. 

My largest projects are:

- **Chime**, a self hosted music streaming server;
- **goputer**, a fantasy virtual machine;
- and the engine for **this blog**.
